This stage is just a warm-up and it shouldn't be confusing, difficult, or require any sort of special insight or research. This is basically a test to make sure all your setup is OK. Good luck! ðŸ‘‹

### Your challange is

1. Add 2 files to the root of the repo: `alice.txt` and `bob.txt`.
2. Commit your changes (should be only one commit!).
3. Push your changes to the remote repo.

### What do I do with the flag

**Make sure you copy and save the flags somewhere!**

You passed this stage of the CTF, so ***check out*** the next stage ðŸ‘€

âš  _Note:_ Don't worry if you see the following error message:

```sh
 ! [remote rejected] start-here -> start-here (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'gamemaster@localhost:~/ctf-repo'
```

It's on purpose. The important part is that you got the flag ðŸš©

{{% expand "áƒš(Â¯ãƒ­Â¯áƒš)   What if I f-ed it up" %}}
Good! That's a good way to learn. You'll need to figure out how to return things to their original state and start over :)
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "áƒš(à² _à²  áƒš)   What if I f-ed it up, for real" %}}
First, return to the original commit from which you've started the challenge (`git checkout origin/start-here`).
Then, set the local `start-here` branch to the current HEAD (`git branch -f start-here`).
Now you can try to solve again.

**For this stage, you must run the script ./setup_hooks_stage.sh first!**

You need to add more than 100 files into the add_files_here directory, and you can't do it in more than 3 commits. Shouldn't be too hard, should it?

*Once you've solved this stage, be sure to undo what `setup_hooks_stage.sh` does ðŸ˜Š*
